# Intelligent-home-embedded-system-testing

### Brief description
STM32 Nucleo-F103RB as intelligent home platform and Raspberry Pi 3B as a linux system-based embedded testing platform. Main goal of this project is to implement intelligent home on stm32 platform and conduct tests using CUnit library on Raspberry Pi. Tests will be run on RPI directly, which will communicate with stm32, sending and receiving values to test intelligent home functionality. Subgoals are:
- Tinkering with Makefiles
- Learning about linker scripts, startup code and vector tables
- Learning to write embedded unit tests
- Learning to automate those tests using bash scripting
- Passing class assignment :)
